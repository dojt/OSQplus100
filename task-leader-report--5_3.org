* Task Description

   Task 5.3: Software stack

   (Partners involved: UTartu*, Wigner RCP, Qruise, TNO, FZJ; Duration: M1-M42)

   Once the QC is fully calibrated, we require an optimizing compiler to best match users’ circuits to each
   hardware’s specific capabilities.  In addition, a Quantum OS is required, allowing lab members and trusted
   collaborators to submit circuits for execution (a.k.a. private cloud), and including everything needed for
   ongoing operations: a scheduler, recalibration and status monitoring.

   Creation of an *optimizing compiler* will be led by UTartu and be comprised of two steps.  In *Phase 1*
   (deliverable D5.3) WP4[sic! should be 5] shall implement an optimizing compiler which would allow arbitrary
   quantum circuits to be executed on OpenSuperQPlus100 hardware.  Optimized mapping of circuit layout and
   gate-set.  In *Phase 2*, the Phase 1 compiler shall be extended to include dynamic adaptation to newly
   calibrated gates and gate error rates as well as support for integration of classical logic in the quantum
   circuit for error correction implementation.

   To allow efficient work by the various project partners, we must allow for shared usage of the QCs.  In other
   words – we must provide for private cloud access.  This will comprise of a means of sending circuits to be
   evaluated, a circuit queue, and a mechanism to return results (milestone MS17).  Further, to allow certain
   maintenance operations of the QCs and to prevent interactive algorithms from going back to the end of the queue
   in each iteration, priorities shall be built into the queuing mechanism.

   It is imperative that QPUs keep operating at the lowest error rates.  For that purpose, recalibration shall be
   implemented, with the goal of minimizing QC downtime and maximizing fidelities throughout.  Finally, basic
   monitoring capabilities will be provided (deliverable D5.7), to allow QC operators to view system health and
   performance.
