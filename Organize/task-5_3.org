      _Task 5.3: Software stack_

      (Partners involved: UTartu*, Wigner RCP, Qruise, TNO, FZJ; Duration: M1-M42)

      Once the QC is fully calibrated, we require an optimizing compiler to best match users’ circuits to each
      hardware’s specific capabilities.  In addition, a Quantum OS is required, allowing lab members and trusted
      collaborators to submit circuits for execution (a.k.a. private cloud), and including everything needed for
      ongoing operations: a scheduler, recalibration and status monitoring.

      Creation of an *optimizing compiler* will be led by UTartu and be comprised of two steps.  In *Phase 1*
      (deliverable D5.3) WP5[fn:1] shall implement an optimizing compiler which would allow arbitrary quantum circuits to
      be executed on OpenSuperQPlus100 hardware.  Optimized mapping of circuit layout and gate-set.  In *Phase 2*,
      the Phase 1 compiler shall be extended to include /dynamic adaptation to newly calibrated gates and gate
      error rates/ as well as support for /integration of classical logic/ in the quantum circuit for error
      correction implementation.

      To allow efficient work by the various project partners, we must allow for shared usage of the QCs.  In other
      words – we must provide for private *cloud access*.  This will comprise of a means of sending circuits to be
      evaluated, a circuit *queue*, and a mechanism to return results (milestone MS17).  Further, to allow certain
      maintenance operations of the QCs and to prevent interactive algorithms from going back to the end of the
      queue in each iteration, priorities shall be built into the queuing mechanism.

      It is imperative that QPUs keep operating at the lowest error rates.  For that purpose, *recalibration* shall
      be implemented, with the goal of minimizing QC downtime and maximizing fidelities throughout.  Finally, basic
      *monitoring* capabilities will be provided (deliverable D5.7), to allow QC operators to view system health
      and performance.

[fn:1] I fixed a typo here: The GA says "WP4".
