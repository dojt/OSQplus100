      _Task 5.3: Software stack_

      (Partners involved: UTartu*, Wigner RCP, Qruise, TNO, FZJ; Duration: M1-M42)

      Once the QC is fully calibrated, we require an optimizing compiler to best match users’ circuits to each
      hardware’s specific capabilities.  In addition, a Quantum OS is required, allowing lab members and trusted
      collaborators to submit circuits for execution (a.k.a. private cloud), and including everything needed for
      ongoing operations: a scheduler, recalibration and status monitoring.

      Creation of an *optimizing compiler* will be led by UTartu and be comprised of two steps.  In *Phase 1*
      (deliverable D5.3) WP5[fn:1] shall implement an optimizing compiler which would allow arbitrary quantum circuits to
      be executed on OpenSuperQPlus100 hardware.  Optimized mapping of circuit layout and gate-set.  In *Phase 2*,
      the Phase 1 compiler shall be extended to include /dynamic adaptation to newly calibrated gates and gate
      error rates/ as well as support for /integration of classical logic/ in the quantum circuit for error
      correction implementation.

      To allow efficient work by the various project partners, we must allow for shared usage of the QCs.  In other
      words – we must provide for private *cloud access*.  This will comprise of a means of sending circuits to be
      evaluated, a circuit *queue*, and a mechanism to return results (milestone MS17).  Further, to allow certain
      maintenance operations of the QCs and to prevent interactive algorithms from going back to the end of the
      queue in each iteration, priorities shall be built into the queuing mechanism.

      It is imperative that QPUs keep operating at the lowest error rates.  For that purpose, *recalibration* shall
      be implemented, with the goal of minimizing QC downtime and maximizing fidelities throughout.  Finally, basic
      *monitoring* capabilities will be provided (deliverable D5.7), to allow QC operators to view system health
      and performance.

** Task 7.3 /Verification & Validation/
*** Task Description

   From the Grant Agreement

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      _Task 7.3: Verification and Validation_

      (Partners involved: UTartu*, UPV/EHU, CHALMERS, FZJ, Qruise, Duration: month 1-42)

      The levels of the enabling software stack communicate via interfaces.  This task is concerned with (a)
      *validating* that the top-level interfaces meet the requirements for application quantum software, including
      quantum gates/circuits with fault tolerance, and (b) *verifying* that the implementations match the
      specifications.  CHALMERS and UPV/EHU will do (a) as /part of their development of application software/ as
      part of the test suite in Tasks 7.1 and 7.2., scheduling it to match the timelines for those tasks.  The
      results of Task 7.3 will be applied at *test nodes* in Task 1.2.  FZJ, Qruise, and UTartu will /develop
      methodology/ for verifying the correctness of the implementations (D7.3 in M42; candidate methods will be
      identified by M6, implementation and validation of the software will begin before M24).  For levels of the
      software stack that link classical input to classical output (e.g., optimization phases in the quantum
      compiler), /quantum simulation/ will be deployed (see Task 7.5).  For the levels of the software stack that
      directly communicate with the control hardware, process tomography and randomized benchmarking, *et cetera*,
      will be used.  CHALMERS will assist with state and process tomography.

*** Task-Leader Reports
**** TLR Nov 2023: Task 7.3 /Verification and Validation/

    * Task leader:
      + UTartu
    * Other project partners participating in the task:
      + FZJ
      + Qruise
      + UPV/EHU
      + CHALMERS

***** Deviations from Annex I., the consequences and the proposed corrective actions

     None.

***** Activities / critical objectives or deliverables

     As indicated in the task description in the GA and then discussed in the consortium meeting in July in Bilbao,
     the work for the valification will be carried out by UPV/EHU and CHALMERS, as, in the context of developing
     applications to run on the stack, they are in the best position to validate the interfaces.

     The next milestone concerning Verification is M24 /M24 Consensus of OpenSuperQPlus100 interface specifications
     for verification/ in Jan-Feb, 2026.  In moving towards that milestone, Task 7.3 implementers are in
     communication with the implementers of Task 8.3 "Standards and interfaces".

     The process of identifying candidate methods for verification has commenced, and UTartu hired
     researcher/specialist to work part-time for identifying and implementing verification methods.  One of the
     senior researchers at UTartu also works part-time on verification methodology as of Oct 1.

***** Implementation risks and mitigation actions

     N/A

***** Unforeseen Risks

     No unforeseen risks are foreseen.

** Sub-Task 7.4.1 /Generic simulator with simple noise models/
*** Task description

      From Grant Agreement: (highlight & paragraph break mine):

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      *UTartu* will *make the cuQuantum* or QuEST quantum-circuit simulator *available* to OpenSuperQPlus100
      partners and *add noise models from OpenSuperQPlus100 hardware*.

      CHALMERS will survey alternative quantum-circuit simulators. Wigner RCP will create infrastructure for
      testing of sampling algorithms and quantum-kernel-based algorithms, using FPGA-based dataflow engines.
