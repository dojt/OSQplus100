      _Task 7.3: Verification and Validation_

      (Partners involved: UTartu*, UPV/EHU, CHALMERS, FZJ, Qruise, Duration: month 1-42)

      The levels of the enabling software stack communicate via interfaces.  This task is concerned with (a)
      *validating* that the top-level interfaces meet the requirements for application quantum software, including
      quantum gates/circuits with fault tolerance, and (b) *verifying* that the implementations match the
      specifications.  CHALMERS and UPV/EHU will do (a) as /part of their development of application software/ as
      part of the test suite in Tasks 7.1 and 7.2., scheduling it to match the timelines for those tasks.  The
      results of Task 7.3 will be applied at *test nodes* in Task 1.2.  FZJ, Qruise, and UTartu will /develop
      methodology/ for verifying the correctness of the implementations (D7.3 in M42; candidate methods will be
      identified by M6, implementation and validation of the software will begin before M24).  For levels of the
      software stack that link classical input to classical output (e.g., optimization phases in the quantum
      compiler), /quantum simulation/ will be deployed (see Task 7.5).  For the levels of the software stack that
      directly communicate with the control hardware, process tomography and randomized benchmarking, *et cetera*,
      will be used.  CHALMERS will assist with state and process tomography.

*** Deviations from Annex I., the consequences and the proposed corrective actions

     None.

*** Activities / critical objectives or deliverables

     As indicated in the task description in the GA and then discussed in the consortium meeting in July in Bilbao,
     the work for the valification will be carried out by UPV/EHU and CHALMERS, as, in the context of developing
     applications to run on the stack, they are in the best position to validate the interfaces.

     The next milestone concerning Verification is M24 /M24 Consensus of OpenSuperQPlus100 interface specifications
     for verification/ in Jan-Feb, 2026.  In moving towards that milestone, Task 7.3 implementers are in
     communication with the implementers of Task 8.3 "Standards and interfaces".

     The process of identifying candidate methods for verification has commenced, and UTartu hired
     researcher/specialist to work with 50% workload for identifying and implementing verification methods.  One of
     the senior researchers at UTartu has 10% workload on verification methodology as of Oct 1.

*** Implementation risks and mitigation actions

*** Unforeseen Risks

     No unforeseen risks are foreseen.
